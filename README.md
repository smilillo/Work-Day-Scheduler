# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description

This project is a work day scheduler that allows a user to schedule events with hour blocks. The user is able to type in an event description to be saved to that block until it is changed. The blocks also display different colors depending on if they represent past, present, or future times. Bootstrap was used in the HTML file to style elements along with a CSS stylesheet. Jquery and dayjs were used throughout the javascript file to allow the desired functions and allow comparison to the current time.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This page can be used to schedule events in your day using hourly blocks. To add an event, type an event description in the space to the right of the corresponding time. After entering an event description, click the save button to the right of the type space. To change an event: delete the current text, type a new event description, and click the save button. If a time block has already passed, it will display with a gray background, the present time block will display with a red background, and future time blocks will display with a green background.
